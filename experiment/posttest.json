      "question": "1. In which of the following scattering(s), the incident and scattered light has the same wavelength?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "tyndall and rayleigh",
        "b": "tyndall and raman",
        "c": "tyndall and brillouin",
        "d": "none of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Tyndall scattering is an elastic scattering and does not absorb any energy from the incident radiation. Rayleigh scattering absorbs negligible energy from the incident radiation.",
        "b": "Raman scattering can absorb or emit energy into the incident radiation.",
        "c": "Brillouin scattering absorbs energy from incoming radiation.",
        "d": ""

    {
      "question": "2. Particles showing tyndall effect has diameter compared to wavelength on incident radiation (ƛ):",
      "answers": {
        "a": "less than ƛ/10",
        "b": "greater than ƛ/10",
        "c": "smaller than ƛ",
        "d": "greater than ƛ"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "particles having diameter smaller than ƛ/10 show rayleigh scattering",
        "b": "particles having diameter greater than ƛ/10 show Mei scattering",
        "c": "particles having diameter smaller than ƛ also show Mei scattering",
        "d": "particles having diameter greater than ƛ show tyndall scattering"

      "question": "3. Why does violet color scatter more than red color in the sky?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Violet color is abundant in the incoming radiation from sun",
        "b": "Air molecules like N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> have diameter which are of the order ƛ/10 or less and they scatter violet more than red.",
        "c": "violet color is refracted more by the atmospheric layers.",
        "d": "red color is absorbed by the air molecules."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "all range of frequency is present in the incoming radiation in the same amount.",
        "b": "the intensity of scattered light varies as V2/λ4  (i.e., proportional to the square of particle volume, V, or to the sixth power of diameter, and inversely as the fourth power of wavelength, λ). Therefore, for a given particle size, violet light is scattered about eight to ten times more than red light.",
        "c": "refraction does not play an important role in the higher intensity of violet color",
        "d": "red color is not absorbed by air molecules."

    {
      "question": "4. Why do metal particles do not show scattering generally?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "metal particles absorb more and scatter less.",
        "b": "metal particles are smaller than  λ/10.",
        "c": "metal particles are non scatterers.",
        "d": "metal particles are insulators."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "metal particles absorb more and scatter less, due to which absorption dominates over scattering when particle size is small.",
        "b": "metal particles are comparable to N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> and should show the same effect as them if they are insulating and non absorbing",
        "c": "metal particles like other particles scatter too, but their absorption dominates over scattering.",
        "d": "metal particles are insulators."

      "question": "1. Which of the following solutions will be transparent to a bright source of light?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "soil and water",
        "b": "sugar solution",
        "c": "milk",
        "d": "corn starch"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "soil and water will not be transparent to light and will show a tyndall effect.",
        "b": "sugar solution will be transparent to light and will not show a tyndall effect.",
        "c": "milk will not let light pass at all. ",
        "d": "corn starch will also not show a tyndall effect."

      "question": "2. What is the one property of a suspension that is different from a solution or a colloid?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "If left to rest,the particles of a suspension will settle down.",
        "b": "The particles of a suspension reflect light.",
        "c": "A suspension is always clear.",
        "d": "Suspensions are colourless."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "particles of suspension settle down if left to rest.",
        "b": "both suspension and colloid show tyndall effect.",
        "c": "suspension is never clear while solution is.",
        "d": "suspension may or may not be colorless."

      "question": "3. What happens if one stirs vigorously to dissolve soap powder in water?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "more soap powder can now be added to the mixture.",
        "b": "the foam starts forming and floats above the water surface.",
        "c": "bubbles start popping in the water.",
        "d": "the soap powder and water separate out."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "soap powder forms lather when stirred in water. This does not allow more soap to be added.",
        "b": "soap solution starts forming lather and floats above the water surface.",
        "c": "bubbles will start forming but they won't pop out due to stirring.",
        "d": "stirring cannot separate the contents of the soap solution."

      "question": "4. When a white light beam is passed through a glass cube containing small dispersed particles, the cube appears either bluish or reddish when viewed from different directions. Why?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "the cube has manufacturing defects.",
        "b": "the dispersed particles scatter light in different wavelengths from different angles.",
        "c": "The cube absorbs all other colors from incoming radiations.",
        "d": "the particles emit bluish or reddish light."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "the manufacturing defects cannot produce this kind of effect.",
        "b": "the wavelength of light scattered due to the tyndall effect depends on angle, polarisations and other factors.",
        "c": "the cube or the particles show color due to scattering and not absorption.",
        "d": "the particles do not emit light but scatter it."
      },

      "correctAnswer": "b"

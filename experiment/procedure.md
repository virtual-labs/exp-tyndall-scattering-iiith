**To start the experiment do the following:**

1. Demonstration of the Tyndall effect is done here with the following six samples: pure water, salt solution, sugar solution, detergent solution, ferric hydroxide colloid, and silver colloid.  
2. Prepare solutions of salt, sugar and detergent and colloids of ferric hydroxide and silver in water. [Refer to the preparation methodologies given in earlier experiments]. Here select one of the items from the top-left shelf by clicking on it and follow the instructions. In the case detergent solution, one should stir the mixture very gently to avoid bubble formation.  
3. In a dark room, pass light through each of the six samples from a torch. Here to perform this step click on any one of the tagged samples on the table and observe.  
4. Note down whether the sample shows the Tyndall effect or not and then conclude whether the sample is a pure liquid, true solution or a colloidal dispersion.  
5. Verify your conclusions by selecting correct answer.       
6. Click on OK tab on the result page and see the microscopic view.     
7. Repeat the above steps for all the other samples.
